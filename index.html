                <p>My name is Alexander Nieves and I love to write code. When I was 18 I
                   I took a course in electronics in a technical school. I graduated and
                   found a job pretty quick. Around two years later I wanted to learn new
                   skills so I decided to go to school for computer repairs and networking
                   but I only lasted about 2 months because the school went out of business.
                   I then decided to give computer programming a try. I took the course and
                   I was able to finish it but I was never able to get a job in programming. I 
                   got discoraged and I stopped searching but I did continue to code because 
                   I enjoyed it. In the last few years I decided to take it a little more serious
                   and try again to see if I can get a job in programming. I studied on my own
                   and decided to get a few certifications. I received first the Linux
                   certification through compTIA and then I went for the Java certifications. In
                   Java I obtained the first two programming certificates from Oracle. I decided
                   to go for the Rutgers coding bootcamp to learn up to date technology.
